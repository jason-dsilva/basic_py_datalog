# basic_py_datalog
This is simple program of data logging in an office.
The receptionist has to collect data of every person entering the office such as his name, contact number, place ,body temperature and time of arrival.
This manual work can be made automatic by using python.
The inputs are given as a loop -> at the end the word "dft" should be used (meaning done for today) -> once done a .txt file will be saved having the present date as the file name for easy access.
